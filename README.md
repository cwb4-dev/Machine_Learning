*15112020: terrorism_kaggle.ipynb*, Notebook contains elaborate examples on how to think about problems and interpret large scale data using [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd). Apart from Pandas Groupby, Crosstab methods I have also used Folium, Basemap libraries for visualizing Leaflet map and 2D data on maps respectively. More on [The Startup](https://medium.com/swlh/practical-data-analysis-using-pandas-global-terrorism-database-20b29009adad).
